# GetBook
Get catalog from api.digitallibrary.io and download selected books
The files in this project may not be worth extending.  If we want
UI, then perhaps an electron app is in order.  But it does provide
a proof of concept in downloading the complete catalog, finding
books by a particular author, and downloading those ePUB files.
